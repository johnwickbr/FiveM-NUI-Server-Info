# FiveM NUI Server Information Menu

Using NUI, Lua, HTML, CSS, and JS to make a User Interface to display server information, discord, and other information.

This can be very useful towards giving people your discord link, how to aquire roles, and just giving general information.

### Usage 

* Rename the file to `server-information` (or whatever you want)
* Drag the folder into your `resources` folder
* Open your `server.cfg` and add `start server-information`
* To open the information menu do `/open` 
* As stated in the UI do `/close` to close the menu

### Customization 

* To edit the text within the UI go to `html/index.html` and edit that file
